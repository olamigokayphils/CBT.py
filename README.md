# CBT.py
Nairaland simple CBT exam in Python. 
Although there are availability of different subjects-
only a single file folder was created for the exam,
I  mean the only feasible exam is  the "Nairaland Exam"
I uploaded the cbt.txt file with it.
It's imperative you copy and save the cbt.txt in the same directory as the .py file on your PC.
Kindly select "N", otherwise it says other subjects not available.
Its open to criticism.
Thank you.
