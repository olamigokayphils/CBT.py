# CBT.py
Nairaland simple CBT exam in Python. 
Although there are availability of different subjects-
only a single file folder was created for the exam
I  mean the only feasible exam is  the "Nairaland Exam"
I uploaded the folder with it.
It's imperative you download and save the cbt.txt in the same directory as the .py file
Kindly select "N", otherwise it says other subjects not available.
Its open to criticism.
Thank you.
